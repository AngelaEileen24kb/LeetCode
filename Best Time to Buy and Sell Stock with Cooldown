Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:

prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
maxProfit = 3
transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

思路:

The series of problems are typical dp. The key for dp is to find the variables to represent the states and deduce the transition function.

Of course one may come up with a O(1) space solution directly, but I think it is better to be generous when you think and be greedy when you implement.

The natural states for this problem is the 3 possible transactions : buy, sell, rest. Here rest means no transaction on that day (aka cooldown).

Then the transaction sequences can end with any of these three states.

For each of them we make an array, buy[n], sell[n] and rest[n].

buy[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with buy.

sell[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with sell.

rest[i] means before day i what is the maxProfit for any sequence end with rest.

Then we want to deduce the transition functions for buy sell and rest. By definition we have:

buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1]-price, buy[i-1]) 
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1]+price, sell[i-1])
rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])
Where price is the price of day i. All of these are very straightforward. They simply represents :

(1) We have to `rest` before we `buy` and 
(2) we have to `buy` before we `sell`
One tricky point is how do you make sure you sell before you buy, since from the equations it seems that [buy, rest, buy] is entirely possible.

Well, the answer lies within the fact that buy[i] <= rest[i] which means rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1]). That made sure [buy, rest, buy] is never occurred.

A further observation is that and rest[i] <= sell[i] is also true therefore

rest[i] = sell[i-1]

可以直接看出,因为buy[i-1] <= rest[i-1] <= sell[i-1],所以rest[i] = max(sell[i-1])
所以上面3个式子可以写成2个:
buy[i] = max(sell[i-2] - price, buy[i-1]); //buy[i]不是说一定要在第i天买,有可能第i-1天买,第i天rest,第i-2天买,第i-1,第i天rest,
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1]); //sell[i]和buy[i]一样,也就是从第0天到第i天的任意一天买的maxprofit

but we can do even better:
Since states of day i relies only on i-1 and i-2 we can reduce the O(n) space to O(1). And here we are at our final solution:

代码如下:
class Solution {
public:
//buy[i] = max(sell[i-2] - price, buy[i-1]),
//sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1])
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() < 2) return 0;
        int buy(-prices[0]), sell(0), pre_buy(0), pre_sell(0);
        for (int price : prices) {
            pre_buy = buy;
            buy = max(pre_sell - price, pre_buy);
            pre_sell = sell;
            sell = max(pre_buy + price, pre_sell);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};

注意:
buy[i] doesn't mean you must buy at day i. It only means you have to compare with the possibility of buy at day i and all other choices like buy at i-1 and rest at i.
You must understand that this problem you can do as many transactions as you want. Not just one transaction.

If you define buy[i] as the maxProfit of all the sequence buy at day i then when you sell at i+1 you have to look through all the buy array from 0 to i to get the maximum profit. This is algorithm is then O(n^2) not O(n) anymore.

But you are right, it seems that rest[i] actually means rest at day i. So why rest is different than buy and sell?

This is because rest don't change your profit.

When we compare all the possible sequence, we are actually comparing with the sequence filled with trailing rests.

when I say:

buy[2] is max of [buy] [rest buy] [rest rest buy]

it is equivalent to

buy[2] is max of [buy rest rest] [rest buy rest] [rest rest buy]

because the trailing rest has no effect on max profit

then for rest[2] the trailing rest will always make it end with rest therefore it seems different then buy and sell
